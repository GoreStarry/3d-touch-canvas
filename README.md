3D Touch Canvas
===

This is a demo for 3D Touch on Mobile Safari on iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. It's a simple line drawing app which you can use the force of the finger to control the width of the drawn line.

Mobile Safari on iOS 9 for iPhone 6S and 6S Plus introduces [3D Touch for web developers](http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/ios9-safari-for-web-developers). The line drawing code is heavily inspired by (or copied from) @kangax's 2013 article: [Exploring canvas drawing techniques](http://perfectionkills.com/exploring-canvas-drawing-techniques/).
